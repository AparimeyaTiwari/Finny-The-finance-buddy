## Setup & Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayak-Khavare/Finny-The-finance-buddy.git
cd Finny-The-finance-buddy
```

### 2. **Set Up Python**
Requires **Python 3.8+**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If `requirements.txt` is missing, you likely need:
- discord.py
- python-dotenv
- aiohttp

```bash
pip install -U discord.py python-dotenv aiohttp
```

### 3. **Configure Environment Variables (.env)**
Create a file named `.env` in your project root:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
```
- [How to get a Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [How to get a Perplexity Developer Key](https://docs.perplexity.ai)

### 4. **Run the Bot**
```bash
python main.py
```
Invite your bot to a Discord server with **`applications.commands`** and **`bot`** scopes.

## Environment Variables & API Keys

| Name                  | Description                  | Example            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN`       | Discord bot token            | `abc123...`        |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`  | Perplexity AI API Key        | `perplexity-xyz..` |

## Database Schema

The `finny.db` SQLite file manages persistent user, transaction, and goal data. Typical tables include:

- **users**:  
    - `user_id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
    - `username` (TEXT)
    - `fincoins` (INTEGER, default 100)
- **transactions**:  
    - `id`, `user_id`, `amount` (int), `type` ("spend", "save"), `description`, `timestamp`
- **goals**:  
    - `user_id`, `name`, `target` (float), `saved` (float)

**Table creation and integrity** are handled automatically on bot startup via the `init_db()` function. (See `database.py`.)

## Extending Finny

Finny is built with modular Python (OOP), Discord's new slash commands, and clean async code.  
**Easy to extend!**
- Add new games, analysis (spending breakdowns), badges/achievements, reminders, server-wide leaderboards, embed themes, and more by building on the existing command framework.
- API integration (Perplexity, finance APIs) is centralized and easy-to-modify.
- All database access uses lightweight context-managed wrappers for future migration (e.g., to PostgreSQL).

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot wonâ€™t start?** Double-check `.env` entries and make sure `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` are correct.
- **Missing permissions?** Grant the bot `Read`, `Send Messages`, and `Use Application Commands` in your Discord server.
- **Database errors?** Delete `finny.db` if corrupted (user data will be lost) or check for race conditions on simultaneous access.
- **Perplexity API errors?** API quota exceeded, or invalid key.
